      <title>Geocenter motion: A mind-boggling phenomenon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, understanding the concept of &amp;lsquo;geocenter motion&amp;rsquo; is not for the faint-hearted. On a good day it is only confusing, while on bad days we would rather avoid the subject all together. The story below is meant to clear the fog somewhat for those of you who have more bad days than good days. We additionally provide links to recently calculated geocenter motion time series, for those of you who want to get started with real data. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scientists! Encrypt your mail if you got nothing to hide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Up to now, I never bothered to encrypt my email as my attitude was that, as a scientist, I got nothing to hide. But in light of the recently installed science-deprived administration in the US, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that a healthy streak of paranoia wouldn&amp;rsquo;t harm after all.

      <title>Guess what: Sea level does rise when you melt floating ice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One may suspect that melting of floating ice would not cause a sea level change, but dissolving a chunk of the Larsen C ice shelf may actually change &lt;em&gt;regional&lt;/em&gt; sea level by up to a meter. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
